          Cond√© Nast is missing out on traffic and revenue because of delays in
          awareness of trending topics. Oftentimes, publishers simply react to
          trending conversations, resulting in slower publishing times &
          preconceived content strategies, as opposed to being ahead of the
          curve and producing more diverse, wider reaching content.
